*Comments*:
 The initially declared end date was June 17. Within the legal instrument, there's a possibility to extend the period of Biosecurity Emergency indefinetly, but only for three months at a time. Already on 14th of May it was declared that the measures will be in place for another 3 months, thus ending on the 17th of September. On September 3, it was declared that it is extended to December 17.

# Austria 
*Answer*: 2020-12-31 

*Comments*:
 In the initial anouncement, all measures taken within the Covid-19 Law was due to end at 13th of April. 
Many measures  have been extended, or parts of their content have been extended (more freedom of movement, but not full freedom for example). The Covid-19 Law has an end date in itself as well,  any measures taken within it can (and in some  cases have or will) end at 2020-12-31. This is therefore regarded as the end date.

*Answer*: 2020-06-15 

*Comments*:
 The state of emergency was declared on March 14 for 30 days (legislative decree n 593), extended on April 12 for 4 days (legislative decree 622), extended on April 16 for 15 days (legislative decree 631) and extended on April 30 for 15 days (legislative decree 634). Then, the president tried to extend it on May 16 for 30 days via executive decree 18, but the decree was considered unconstitutional by the supreme court and suspended on May 18, because it did not have legislative approval. The president insisted on declaring a new state of emergency and after a few days of debate between the executive and the legislative, the legislative decree 648 from May 30 declared state of emergency for another 15 days and defined guidelines for reopening the country. The president then vetoed this decree on June 6, but the legislative overcame his veto on June 11. Bukele tried to define guidelines for reopening the country via the executive decrees 31 and 32, which were not approved by the national assembly. The legislative tried to define their own guidelines via the legislative decree 661 from June 12, which Bukele also vetoed. The conflict went to the supreme court, which considered the executive decrees unconstitutional because they imposed limits to constitutional rights without legislative approval. They considered the legislative decree legal and that the president should approve it, which he did on August 31, but he didn't publish it and the dates defined in the decree had already passed. This conflict between executive and legislative left an uncertainty in the country. The supreme court annouced that the measures imposed via the executive decree 32 would be lifted on August 23 due to their uncostitutionality, and that the executive and the legislative should reach an agreement by then. They didn't, and the country officially reopened on August 24, although there wasn't a state of emergency in place since June 15.

*Comments*:
 The Imposition of Restrictions Act (2020) allows for restrictions to be declared "for a period of not more than three months" but also allows the president to extend these restrictions for "not more than one month at a time but in any event for not more than three months" (Article 4). The president initially imposed restrictions on movement, gatherings, and travel for two to three weeks. He has invoked the right and extended the provisions on several occasions, most recently 15 June 2020. Presently, according to E.I. 64 of 15 March, the main emergency provisions under the restrictions act are set to expire on 31 July. However, there are reports from August & September which state that "[...] we are still required under the Imposition of Restrictions Act 2020 [...]" and I have also not found evidence of it lifted/expired to date.

# Lesotho 
*Answer*: 2020-05-05 

*Comments*:
 The Constitution of Lesotho limits a state of emergency to 14 days, unless authorized by the legislature, which may allow for a period of no more than six-months. The legislature refused to approve a measure that would have extended the state of emergency beyond the initial 14 day period allowed for in the constitution. At that time, it had been suspended by the prime minister. Later the constitutional court ruled the suspension of parliament unconstitutional. It has since been reinstated and the prime minister resigned.

# Malawi 
*Answer*: 2020-04-19 

*Comments*:
 The Disaster Preparedness and Relief Act allows for an initial state of disaster to last for three months and to be extended for another three months. President Mutharika initially announced a 30-day period for the state of disaster. Later, on 01 April, the government invoked the Public Health Act to issue the Public Health (Corona Virus Prevention, Containment, and Management) Rules on 08 April. However, the 21-day lockdown proposed in these rules was halted by the High Court of Malawi on 17 April 2020. We code the official end date based on the initial 30-day period for the state of disaster because we could find no evidence of its extension.

 Time limit depends on the particular measures (such as 1 August 2020, 1 September 2020), with some measures until 31 December 2020. Some measures do not have a time limit. According to IDEA, "In late April, the Tajik Prime Minister's COVID-19 Task Force cancelled all public events indefinitely. As of September, the prohibition is still in place. " There is also no end date for the restictions on public events in the press release of the state news agency "Khovar" (no other legislation or official announcement on the President's website found).
