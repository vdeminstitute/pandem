*Comments*:
 'On 9 April the Burkinabé security forces allegedly executed 31 detainees following a counter-terrorism operation in Djibo, approximately 200 kilometers north of the capital, Ouagadougou. According to witness testimony gathered by Human Rights Watch, security force personnel arrested the unarmed civilians in response to the presence of armed Islamist groups around Djibo. All 31 men were from the Peuhl (also known as Fulani) ethnic group. In a statement issued on 20 April, the Ministry of Defense said it does not target its own people and if these allegations against the security forces are true, it will take action.''
