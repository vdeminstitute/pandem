 Afghanistan's biggest news agency, Pajhwok Afghan News, has been harrassed since it reported on 32 ventilators that were meant for Afghan Covid-19 patients that were stolen and sold to Pakistan. The director of the agency was interrogated by representative from the health ministry the day after the report was released.

 A journalist was threated by a construction worker from a private company after filming violations of the curfew. The source that IPI refers to mentions that the company is favored by the government, but this is not sufficient to classify it as the government's agent. No new information found since June 2020.

 1: On 8 May 2020, Chris Buckley a foreign correspondent with the NYT who spent 76 days in Wuhan reporting on the Covid-19 crisis, was forced out of China on May 8th after the authorities refused to renew his visa. The Australian native, based in China for the past 24 years, was personally attacked in recent months by Chinese state media for his reporting on the epidemic, which included how government secrecy delayed the fight against the virus and public anger over the death of whistleblower, Dr, Li Wenliang.
2: On 27 March 2020 at least 13 US foreign correspondents were forced to leave China. 
I have coded this as verbal harassment as they were asked/forced to leave the country and no physical harm was inflicted upon them.

*Comments*:
 Greek police detained and attacked a Greek journalist, Antonis Rigopoulos, on November 17 while he was covering a rally in commemoration of the 1973 Polytechnic University student uprising against the military dictatorship. 

''As the journalist was documenting the arrest of protesters, he was approached by traffic police officers, and despite the fact that he was wearing a full gas mask, police tried to fine him €300 under COVID-19 regulations for not wearing a surgical mask. The officers then brought him to the headquarters of the Traffic Police where Rigopoulos claims they addressed him in a threatening and abusive manner in an attempt to provoke him. He later reported that one officer pushed him forcefully into a chair and shouted aggressively in his face. Rigopoulos added that officers repeatedly refused to acknowledge his journalistic ID and took his national ID off him for about half an hour.''

 The Guatemala Journalists Association released a report on Freedom of Expression in Guatemala during the first four months of 2020, in which it reports cases of verbal and physical harassment of journalists (pages 13-15). Additionally, the Human Rights Ombudsman reports on their website several complaints from journalists of verbal and physical harassment.

 At about 11:00 a.m. on April 2, several unidentified men punched and hit a group of eight reporters at the National Identification Office, a government department that manages citizens’ identification cards, while they were investigating claims that the office was violating COVID-19 guidelines by keeping applicants in close quarters, according to news reports and Robest Dimanche, one of the journalists, who spoke with CPJ in a phone interview. Some of the attackers were wearing t-shirts identifying them as personnel from the National Identification Office, and others were wearing shirts identifying them as employees of the Ministry of the Interior and “Public Security,” according to a complaint filed by the journalists to the public prosecutor’s office, which CPJ reviewed.'' 

''In April, a protest broke out in the capital of Haiti after the arrestation of Mr. Louko Desir after saying a speech on Radio Télé Eclair during his popular radio show called Matin Debat. From some reports, the journalist and the radio host was released from Jail hours later. According to local media like Bon Déjeuner! Radio (BDR! Live) and Radio Télé Eclair, Mr. Louko Desir who is a Journalist and the host of Matin Debat at Radio Télé Eclair were arrested after saying the Haitian Government is lying about the COVID-19 in Haiti. After Mr. Louko Desir said that there are no cases of COVID-19 in Haiti, he was arrested shortly after that speech on the radio.'' 

Also in April, ''A reporter for Radio Television Caribbean, Georges Allen was beaten and arrested by a police patrol for allegedly violating a government imposed curfew, despite the journalists showing his credentials that exempt him from the curfew regulations.'' 

The curfew is still ongoing in the October-December period, even though the state of health emergency has been lifted.

 A cartoonist working for a newspaper was verbally attacked and threatened by the authorities and pro-government media. A journalist was verbally attacked and threaten by a TV channel close to the government, after she critisized the emergency measures. According to IPI, " journalists reporting on the reality of the situation inside hospitals are regularly denounced as “scaremongers” by the public service broadcaster." Since the reports appear systemic and I have not found any evidence verbal harassment has stopped, mevhar is coded as 1 in all time periods.

*Comments*:
 Citizens and journalists have been detained in Morocco for expressing their views:  ''According to the Moroccan Association for Human Rights (AMDH), as of March 2020, the number of prisoners detained for legitimately expressing their views across the country reached 110. On 28th March 2020, the secretary general of the presidency of the public prosecutor's office reported that the police had arrested 450 individuals for breaking the public health emergency law and 56 for publishing false information on COVID-19. The situation of those detained and imprisoned are being monitored by rights groups.
Human rights groups have called for the release of those freely expressing their opinion, including the release of journalists. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) issued a statement to all African countries, including Morocco, where four journalists are imprisoned and called for the release of jailed journalists and to protect the free press and the free flow of information at this crucial time.'' (1)

Also, a Moroccan citizen journalist, Ibrahim Amrikli, was charged on 17 May by the prosecutor of the Court of First Instance in Laayoune with "breaking orders related to the health emergency status",based on the health emergency Decree law passed in March 2020, and with "offending public officials", based on article 263of the penal code. The trial was postponed for the end of September. (2)

In addition, ''Journalist Nazha ElKhalidi and her fiancée have been put under house arrest since November 21. The journalist was detained by Moroccan security services due to her coverage of human rights violations by Moroccan authorities in Western Sahara. She has recently noted and reported the crackdown on freedom of expression by the Morrocan authorities in Western Sahara. Morrocan authorities claimed that this measure is part of its COVID-19 precautionary procedures. Nazha and her fiancée confirmed that social distancing and other precautionary measures were taken into account when organizing the ceremony.'' (3)

 Reporters without borders have reported on multiple instances of journalists being harassed.

2: "In the eastern district of Khotang, the local leader of the opposition Congress Party telephoned and threatened Prabhavnews website editor Uttam Chaulagain after the site reported that the politician had not cooperated in quarantining someone suspected of having Covid-19. "You could lose your life for writing such news," he told Chaulagain."

I have not found new cases of jounalists being verbally harrassed in the Oct/Dec period. However, given the high frequency at which such things occured at the beginning of the pandemic and Nepal's controlled media environemnt, I have coded this variable as 1.

 'Niger police interrogate TV editor and journalist over interview, March 14, 2020: Judicial police in Niger summoned the editor-in-chief and a journalist of Television Labari, following an article the outlet published which interviewed a prominent veterinarian about the COVID-19 pandemic.''

On March 25 2020, Kaka Touda, an independent journalist who publishes news reports on his Facebook and Twitter pages, In Niger's capital Niamey, was arrested for his social media post about a suspected Coronavirus case in a local hospital, which filed a complaint against him. The hospital said in the complaint that the March 4 social media post posed a threat to law and order.''

Also: ''In the days before the demonstration, several journalists had been targeted: summoned by the police or arrested after speaking out or for conducting interviews related to the issue of the COVID-19 pandemic. One of them, Mamane Kaka Touda, journalist and human rights defender, is still detained, accused of "disseminating data which may disturb public order" simply for having shared information on the existence of a suspect case.''

*Comments*:
 The Police Minister called for the resignation of two journalists reporting on the governments response to Covid-19, stating that they "can't be trusted" (the minister did not, however, start any investigation or call for arrests). This is deemed a verbal harassment of  these journalists, and thus coded as 1. Furthermore, the National Pandemic Act criminalizes spreading false and misleading information on the public health emergency, which allows for interrogation and arresting of media workers if they have been deemed committing any such offense. While no reports have been found of verbal harassment in the second period, there has not been found any evidence of improvement either. This is therefore coded as 1 for both periods.

 The Prime Minister published a denigrating statement towards journalists in general and the country's two main TV channels on 11 May, as well as accusations of lying and threats over the funding of the country's public TV channel on Twitter on 21-22 March. Blaž Zgaga, a journalist for RSF, was insulted and verbally threatened by the authorities after asking about a new Covid-19 crisis unit. On 2 August, the Acting Director of the Government Communication Office (UKOM) " tweeted urging citizens to report and denounce any media or journalists in Slovenia who “obviously and shamelessly use manipulations” in their work to purposefully mislead people". On 15 October,  Prime Minister Janez Janša verbally attacked the Slovenian Press Agency on twitter. The statements did not specifically target journalists reporting on Covid-19,  but they indicate that verbal harassment towards journalists in general is ongoing, which can be seen as evidence that the situation did not improve.

# Somalia

*Time period: Q3*: 1

 
*Time period: Q4*: 1

 

*Comments*:
 The state is investigating and jailing journalists, accusing them of offending the honor or prestige of the head of state, or spreading fake news. Also, and more clearly verbal harassment, an official from the presidential palace reached a journalist via Twitter asking him where he got his sources.  I found no evidence that the violations stopped, so mevhar is coded as 1 in all time periods.

 Neither Reporters without Borders nor International Press Institute have reported any verbal harassment of journalists in UK, and no other indications have been found of there having been any such harassment during March-June or July-September 2020.

However, on November 5 2020, ''Journalists and photographers covering an anti-lockdown protest in London were ordered to leave and threatened with arrest by police. Photographers covering the event had reported that police were “hostile and very aggressive” towards members of the press throughout the evening''.

*Comments*:
 There are numerous instances in which the President and his colleagues have verbally harrassed journalists and news agencies. Reporters without borders have published two articles on this, and the verbal harassment of individual journalists and news agencies are widely covered in the press in general, especially those stemming from the President. However, reports of this have only been found in the first period, and this is therefore only coded 1 for this period. Note also that some journalists have been subject to verbal and physical harassment when covering Black Lives Matter-protests and election protests, but these are not regarded here as they are not directly linked to Covid-19.
