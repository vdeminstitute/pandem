## Emergency measures legal instrument (*emlaw*) 

*Question*: What legal instrument has the state used to adopt a national-level emergency response to the Covid-19 pandemic? 

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in the primary legal instrument used to adopt and enforce the main national-level emergency measures with reference to Covid-19 since March 11, 2020. If the country has used multiple instruments, choose the one that most closely resembles a ``state of exception”, defined as a period during which one person or the government has enhanced powers and authority to limit rights and freedoms beyond what the law ordinarily allows (e.g. see [link](https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/S/bo3534874.html) (Agamben 2005). Note that the emergency measures may have ended by the time of coding. 

*Scale*: Categorical 

 1. Declaration of state of emergency, within existing legal framework. 
 2. Declaration of state of public health emergency, within existing legal framework that distinguishes between a public health emergency and a state of emergency. 
 3. Declaration of state of disaster / catastrophe, within existing legal frameworks where this differs from a state of emergency. 
 4. Adopting new legislation, where this differs from a state of emergency, public health emergency, or disaster/catastrophe. 
 5. None, the state has a national-level emergency response without specific reference to legal instruments. 
 6. None, the state has no national-level emergency response. 
 7. Other. 

*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 Constitution (2018) Articles 96, 97, 127, 130.
Order 044 (Ordonnance n° 44 du 27 octobre 1962 relative à l'état d'urgence).
Coded as 1 instrad of 2 because the Constitution does not offer a distinct provision for a state of health emergency,despite the fact that what was officially declared was a state of health emergency (the constitution articles looks as if they allow for adjusted language to the nature of the crisis (e.g. “state of siege”) as warranted.

*Clarification*:  Does the law require that the national legislature approve the implementation of the legal instrument used as the main national-level response to Covid-19?

*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 Article 96 •  When the Institutions of the Republic, ...are threatened in a serious and immediate manner, ....., the President of the Republic, after obligatory consultation of the President of the National Assembly and with the President of the Supreme Court, takes in the Council of Ministers, for a time period not exceeding thirty (30) days, the exceptional measures required by the circumstances.
This period may only be extended after the conforming opinion of the National Assembly.

## Legislature limitations (*leglimit*) 

*Question*: To what extent is the lawmaking role of the legislature limited due to any of the emergency measures taken with reference to the Covid-19 pandemic? 

*Clarification*: By national legislature, we mean the national body with powers to examine, pass, amend, or repeal laws.   The lawmaking role of the national legislature includes the de-jure and de-facto powers to introduce and pass legislation in all policy areas. This question asks specifically how the emergency measures have affected the lawmaking powers of the legislature. ``Rule by decree” enables the government to pass laws without the approval of the legislature, through what is commonly referred to as a decree, regulation, or ordinance, but can also be referred to by other terms.  If no legislature existed prior to Covid-19, code as 5. 

*Scale*: Categorical, (0-5) 

 0. Not at all. The lawmaking role of the national legislature is not affected. 
 1. Very little. The legislature has given the executive branch the power to relatively widely interpret Covid-19 related laws, but not to rule by decree. 
 2. Somewhat. The executive branch has the right to rule by decree on several, narrowly Covid-19 related issues such as deciding on physical distance measures and measures to support the health system. 
 3. To a large extent. The executive branch has the right to rule by decree on many issues, which may exceed Covid-19 related issues due to vague formulation in emergency laws. 
 4. Completely. The legislature has been dissolved, suspended or equivalent with reference to Covid-19. 
 5. No legislature existed prior to Covid-19. 

*Answer*: 2 

*Comments*:
 It is not very clear. The president may take measures by ordinance during the emergency situation, and the National Assembly cannot be dissolved, but Chad has been postponing its parliamentary elections since 2015, and are now delayed again because of the coronavirus for 2021.

''at the National Assembly, "the offices of the members of the bureau, the commissions and the general secretariat must reduce the presence of staff in the offices to the necessary". But "the work in committee continues with the strict observation of barrier gestures and the systematic disinfection of meeting rooms", ensures the Monitoring Committee.''

Article 97
The measures taken by virtue of the preceding Article must be motivated by the will
to assure constitutional public powers, within the least time period, the means to
accomplish their mission.
Also, Article 96 • When the Institutions of the Republic, the independence of the Nation, the territorial integrity or the fulfilment of international commitments are threatened in a serious and immediate manner, such that the regular functioning of the public powers is interrupted, the President of the Republic, after obligatory consultation of the President of the National Assembly and with the President of the Supreme Court, takes in the Council of Ministers, for a time period not exceeding thirty (30) days, the exceptional measures required by the circumstances. This period may only be extended after the conforming opinion of the National
Assembly. The National Assembly meets of plain right if it is not in session.

Article 97 constitution: The National Assembly may not be dissolved during the exercise of exceptional powers.

## Sub-national variation (*subvar*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, to what extent have the emergency measures referring to Covid-19 varied de jure at the sub-national level? 

*Clarification*: Coders should identify and cite sources indicating that subnational governments have implemented varying responses to the pandemic between 11 March 2020 until the coding date. 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Almost no variation. The emergency measures are uniform or nearly uniform throughout the country. 
 1. A little. There are a few sub-national areas where the emergency measures differ. 
 2. Somewhat. There are some sub-national areas where the emergency measures differ. 
 3. Almost completely. The emergency measures vary across all or almost all of the sub-national areas of the country. 

*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 DÉCRÈTE, Article 1 : En l’application des dispositions des articles 100 et 120 de la Constitution, il est institué l’état d’urgence sanitaire sur tout le territoire de la République du Tchad pour une durée de 21 jours (state of health emergency throughout the territory).

But the curfew applied to certain areas: ''Un couvre-feu a été instauré dans les provinces du Logone Occidental, du Logone Oriental, du Mayo-Kebbi Ouest, du Mayo-Kebbi Est, dans la ville de N’Djamena, à Mandelia, au Logone-Gana et de N’Djamena-Farah à Guitté, de 20h à 5h du matin.''

## Discrim (*discrim*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, have any of the emergency measures that place restrictions on democratic rights or freedoms discriminated "solely on the ground of race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin" (ICCPR Art 4)? 

*Clarification*: This indicator captures whether the emergency measures have affected some groups' democratic rights and freedoms disproportionately based on their race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin in ways that cannot be justified by concerns for public health. Democratic rights and freedoms are defined as freedom of movement, assembly, association, and expression. This includes, for instance, quarantines for specific social groups without explicit virological indication. If measures are applied to neighborhoods due to prevalence of Covid-19 cases, this does not count as discrimination. Do not code cases of discrimination dealing with access to medical care, testing, or supplies. 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. No, not at all. 
 1. Not de-jure, but minor de-facto discrimination. 
 2. Not de-jure, but major, systematic de-facto discrimination. 
 3. Yes, minor de-jure discrimination. 
 4. Yes, major, systematic de-jure discrimination 

*Answer*: 0 

*Comments*:

## Non-derogable rights (*ndrights*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, have any of the emergency measures de-jure violated non-derogable rights as defined by the ICCPR? 

*Clarification*: This question addresses the text of the main national-level emergency measures (de-jure). Do not consider the extent to which such provisions have been enforced. Non-derogable rights include: 
 - Right to life (Article 6). 
 - Freedom from torture and cruel/inhuman treatment (Article 7).  
 - Prohibition of slavery and servitude (Article 8, I and II). 
 - Prohibition of imprisonment due to inability to fulfill a contractual obligation (Article 11). 
 - No conviction for a crime which was not a crime at the time of commitment (Article 15). 
 - Right as a person before the law (Article 16). 
 - Freedom of thought, conscience and religion (Article 18). The detailed ICCPR provisions can be found [here](www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx). A temporary ban on religious services does NOT count as a violation of freedom of religion as long as all religions are targeted equally. Provide detailed information about the de-jure violations, including which non-derogable rights are violated in the ndrights_comments variable.

## Media limitations (*melim*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, to what extent do any emergency measures de-jure limit media freedom? 

*Clarification*: This addresses the text of the main national-level emergency measures (de-jure). Do not consider the extent to which such provisions have been enforced. Coders should only consider how the emergency measures affect media freedoms within the country, not other laws or practices. For instance, a case may be coded as 0 - "Not at all" if the emergency measures do not de-jure limit media freedoms, even if the case already had low media freedoms in practice prior to the crisis. 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Not at all. Media freedoms are not affected by the emergency measures. 
 1. Somewhat. The emergency measures de-jure allow the government to put some limitations on how the media can report on Covid-19. These provisions are explicitly limited to stopping disinformation on Covid-19, such as closing news websites that misreport on the origins or how the disease spreads (as a reference to 'fact check' what is 'disinformation'', please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided [here](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses)). 
 2. To a large extent. The emergency measures de-jure put strict limitations on how the media can report on Covid-19. These provisions are not limited to stopping the spread of disinformation on Covid-19, but include any reporting on Covid-19 such as the prevalence of the virus and the government response (as a reference to 'fact check' what is 'disinformation', please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided [here](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses)). 
 3. Almost completely. The emergency measures de-jure require that all or almost all media reporting on Covid-19 reflect the government's position.

## Government misinformation (*govmis*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, how often does information provided by the government or its agents about Covid-19 related matters deviate from the official information provided by the World Health Organization (WHO)? 

*Clarification*: This question is not about specific policies on Covid-19 or minor variations on how governments officially communicate about Covid-19-related matters (e.g. whether masks are recommended or not) but aims at capturing the dissemination of gravely misleading and false information by governments on key facts about Covid-19 such as what it is, how it is transmitted, or how it can be treated or cured. As a reference to “fact check” what is ``false", please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses. Coders should document the source showing the information from the government or its agents and explain how this deviates from the official WHO information (using the source and comments fields). 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0.  Never, or almost never. The information provided by the government and its agents' never or almost never deviates from the official information provided by the WHO. 
 1. Occasionally. There are a few reported instances where the government or its agents have communicated information on Covid-19 that deviates from the official information provided by the WHO, but this is not necessarily intentional. 
 2. Often. The government or some of its agents frequently disseminate information on many key issues concerning Covid-19 that deviates from official information provided by the WHO. 
 3. Always or almost always. The government and its agents systematically disseminate information on a wide range of basic matters concerning Covid-19 that always or almost always deviates from the official information provided by the WHO.

## Military involvement (*milinv*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, has the military been tasked with enforcing any confinement measures? 

*Clarification*: 'Confinement measures' refer to measures restricting citizens' freedom of movement. Such measures include  quarantines, lockdowns, curfews and  travel restriction within the country. 'The military' refers to the set of armed organizations responsible for external security that are primarily composed of active-duty members (as opposed to reserve forces). We are interested in whether the military has been given the power to ensure these measures are respected using coercion. We are not interested in whether the military is deployed to deliver aid or provide help to healthcare facilities.
