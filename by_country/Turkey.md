## Emergency measures legal instrument (*emlaw*) 

*Question*: What legal instrument has the state used to adopt a national-level emergency response to the Covid-19 pandemic? 

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in the primary legal instrument used to adopt and enforce the main national-level emergency measures with reference to Covid-19 since March 11, 2020. If the country has used multiple instruments, choose the one that most closely resembles a ``state of exception”, defined as a period during which one person or the government has enhanced powers and authority to limit rights and freedoms beyond what the law ordinarily allows (e.g. see [link](https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/S/bo3534874.html) (Agamben 2005). Note that the emergency measures may have ended by the time of coding. 

*Scale*: Categorical 

 1. Declaration of state of emergency, within existing legal framework. 
 2. Declaration of state of public health emergency, within existing legal framework that distinguishes between a public health emergency and a state of emergency. 
 3. Declaration of state of disaster / catastrophe, within existing legal frameworks where this differs from a state of emergency. 
 4. Adopting new legislation, where this differs from a state of emergency, public health emergency, or disaster/catastrophe. 
 5. None, the state has a national-level emergency response without specific reference to legal instruments. 
 6. None, the state has no national-level emergency response. 
 7. Other. 

*Answer*: 4 

*Comments*:
 The Turkish constitution allows for the declaration of a state of emergency (as does the Law on the State of Emergency [Law no. 2935]), but such action requires that all emergency presidential decrees be sent to Parliament the same day, debated and resolved within three months otherwise they are considered repealed. Turkey has not adopted a state of emergency, rather the executive has issued decrees with reference to ordinary laws -- Law on the Protection of Public Health (Law no. 1593) and the Law on Provincial Administration (Law no. 5442) -- thereby avoiding legislative approval. A prior Constitutional Court judgement in 2016 allows for vague adoption of measures related to emergencies.

*Comments*:
 Turkey has used a varied set of existing legal instruments to implement emergency response (e.g.  The Law on the Protection of Public Health (Law no.1593) and the Law on Provincial Administration (Law no.5442)), and there is therefore no single legal instrument to highlight here.

*Question*: Did the legislature approve the implementation of the legal instrument used as the main national-level response to Covid-19? 

*Clarification*: This question refers to the legal instrument used to adopt the enhanced powers as defined in *emlaw*. By national legislature, we mean the national body with powers to examine, pass, amend, or repeal laws.

## Legislature limitations (*leglimit*) 

*Question*: To what extent is the lawmaking role of the legislature limited due to any of the emergency measures taken with reference to the Covid-19 pandemic? 

*Clarification*: By national legislature, we mean the national body with powers to examine, pass, amend, or repeal laws.   The lawmaking role of the national legislature includes the de-jure and de-facto powers to introduce and pass legislation in all policy areas. This question asks specifically how the emergency measures have affected the lawmaking powers of the legislature. ``Rule by decree” enables the government to pass laws without the approval of the legislature, through what is commonly referred to as a decree, regulation, or ordinance, but can also be referred to by other terms.  If no legislature existed prior to Covid-19, code as 5. 

*Scale*: Categorical, (0-5) 

 0. Not at all. The lawmaking role of the national legislature is not affected. 
 1. Very little. The legislature has given the executive branch the power to relatively widely interpret Covid-19 related laws, but not to rule by decree. 
 2. Somewhat. The executive branch has the right to rule by decree on several, narrowly Covid-19 related issues such as deciding on physical distance measures and measures to support the health system. 
 3. To a large extent. The executive branch has the right to rule by decree on many issues, which may exceed Covid-19 related issues due to vague formulation in emergency laws. 
 4. Completely. The legislature has been dissolved, suspended or equivalent with reference to Covid-19. 
 5. No legislature existed prior to Covid-19. 

*Answer*: 3 

*Comments*:
 The Turkish Parliament suspended sessions for six weeks from 16 April to 31 May 2020, with direct reference to Covid-19. Media reported on 26 June that parliament had again shut until 30 June due to the virus. The Turkish constitution allows for the declaration of a state of emergency (as does the Law on the State of Emergency [Law no. 2935]), but such action requires that all emergency presidential decrees be sent to Parliament the same day, debated and resolved within three months otherwise they are considered repealed. Turkey has not adopted a state of emergency, rather the executive has issued decrees with reference to ordinary laws -- Law on the Protection of Public Health (Law no. 1593) and the Law on Provincial Administration (Law no. 5442) -- thereby avoiding legislative approval. A prior Constitutional Court judgement in 2016 allows for vague adoption of measures related to emergencies.

## Sub-national variation (*subvar*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, to what extent have the emergency measures referring to Covid-19 varied de jure at the sub-national level? 

*Clarification*: Coders should identify and cite sources indicating that subnational governments have implemented varying responses to the pandemic between 11 March 2020 until the coding date. 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Almost no variation. The emergency measures are uniform or nearly uniform throughout the country. 
 1. A little. There are a few sub-national areas where the emergency measures differ. 
 2. Somewhat. There are some sub-national areas where the emergency measures differ. 
 3. Almost completely. The emergency measures vary across all or almost all of the sub-national areas of the country. 

*Answer*: 0 

*Comments*:
 The emergency measures taken in Turkey are made by the national government, and I have found no indication that there is any sub-national variation in this. The government has, however, imposed curfews and lockdowns differently across the country, with stronger restrictions in highly populated areas, but these are actions taken by the national government and not by sub-national entitites.

## Discrim (*discrim*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, have any of the emergency measures that place restrictions on democratic rights or freedoms discriminated "solely on the ground of race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin" (ICCPR Art 4)? 

*Clarification*: This indicator captures whether the emergency measures have affected some groups' democratic rights and freedoms disproportionately based on their race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin in ways that cannot be justified by concerns for public health. Democratic rights and freedoms are defined as freedom of movement, assembly, association, and expression. This includes, for instance, quarantines for specific social groups without explicit virological indication. If measures are applied to neighborhoods due to prevalence of Covid-19 cases, this does not count as discrimination. Do not code cases of discrimination dealing with access to medical care, testing, or supplies. 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. No, not at all. 
 1. Not de-jure, but minor de-facto discrimination. 
 2. Not de-jure, but major, systematic de-facto discrimination. 
 3. Yes, minor de-jure discrimination. 
 4. Yes, major, systematic de-jure discrimination 

*Answer*: 0 

*Comments*:
 There seem to be no discriminating elements in the measures taken in reference to Covid-19, and  no reports on any discrimination within the emergency measures are reported by Amnesty International or Human Rights Watch. Therefore, this variable is coded as 0.

## Non-derogable rights (*ndrights*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, have any of the emergency measures de-jure violated non-derogable rights as defined by the ICCPR? 

*Clarification*: This question addresses the text of the main national-level emergency measures (de-jure). Do not consider the extent to which such provisions have been enforced. Non-derogable rights include: 
 - Right to life (Article 6). 
 - Freedom from torture and cruel/inhuman treatment (Article 7).  
 - Prohibition of slavery and servitude (Article 8, I and II). 
 - Prohibition of imprisonment due to inability to fulfill a contractual obligation (Article 11). 
 - No conviction for a crime which was not a crime at the time of commitment (Article 15). 
 - Right as a person before the law (Article 16). 
 - Freedom of thought, conscience and religion (Article 18). The detailed ICCPR provisions can be found [here](www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx). A temporary ban on religious services does NOT count as a violation of freedom of religion as long as all religions are targeted equally. Provide detailed information about the de-jure violations, including which non-derogable rights are violated in the ndrights_comments variable. 

*Scale*: Binary, (0/1) 

 0. No. 
 1. Yes. 

*Answer*: 0 

*Comments*:
 There is no de jure violation of non-derogable rights in the measures taken in reference to Covid-19, and no reports on any such violations in the enacted measures are reported by Amnesty International or Human Rights Watch. Therefore, this variable is coded as 0.

## Media limitations (*melim*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, to what extent do any emergency measures de-jure limit media freedom? 

*Clarification*: This addresses the text of the main national-level emergency measures (de-jure). Do not consider the extent to which such provisions have been enforced. Coders should only consider how the emergency measures affect media freedoms within the country, not other laws or practices. For instance, a case may be coded as 0 - "Not at all" if the emergency measures do not de-jure limit media freedoms, even if the case already had low media freedoms in practice prior to the crisis. 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Not at all. Media freedoms are not affected by the emergency measures. 
 1. Somewhat. The emergency measures de-jure allow the government to put some limitations on how the media can report on Covid-19. These provisions are explicitly limited to stopping disinformation on Covid-19, such as closing news websites that misreport on the origins or how the disease spreads (as a reference to 'fact check' what is 'disinformation'', please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided [here](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses)). 
 2. To a large extent. The emergency measures de-jure put strict limitations on how the media can report on Covid-19. These provisions are not limited to stopping the spread of disinformation on Covid-19, but include any reporting on Covid-19 such as the prevalence of the virus and the government response (as a reference to 'fact check' what is 'disinformation', please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided [here](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses)). 
 3. Almost completely. The emergency measures de-jure require that all or almost all media reporting on Covid-19 reflect the government's position.  

*Answer*: 0 

*Comments*:
 There are no reports found that any of the emergency measures places any de jure limitations on media. While media freedom is heavily restricted in Turkey, and harassment is on-going during the pandemic, there are no reports that any de jure limitations have been imposed as a part of Covid-19 measures, or during the pandemic.

## Limitations on media reporting about Covid-19 (*merepfact*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, has the government placed de-facto limitations on media reporting about the nature of the Covid-19 virus? 

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in the de-facto limitation of media reporting on the virus, its origins, treatment, and prevalence. These limits may or may not be allowed by law. Provide specific references to sources and comments to justify coding. 

*Scale*: Binary, (0/1) 

 0. No. 
 1. Yes. 

*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 Both Amnesty International and Reporters without borders report that several journalists have been arrested and charged, and media outlets being censored, as a result of them reporting on Covid-19 and how its spreading in Turkey.

## Limitations on media reporting about the government response to Covid-19 (*merepgov*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, has the government placed de-facto limitations on media reporting about the government response to the Covid-19 pandemic? 

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in the de-facto limitation of media reporting about news on the government responses to Covid-19. If this includes limitations on reporting about the government's official messaging on the pandemic (e.g. its prevalence, treatment, or origins), code this and *merepfact*  as 1- Yes. These limits may or may not be allowed by law. Provide specific references to sources and comments to justify coding. 

*Scale*: Binary, (0/1) 

 0. No. 
 1. Yes. 

*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 Both Amnesty International and Reporters without borders report that several journalists have been arrested and charged, and media outlets being censored, as a result of them reporting on Covid-19 and how its spreading, and accusing the Turkish government of giving incorrect figures of the number of cases and spread of the virus in Turkey. As this is part of the government response, this is coded as 1.

## Limitations on media reporting about non-Covid-19 related news (*merepoth*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, has the government placed de-facto limitations on media reporting about non-Covid-19 related news, but with reference to the pandemic? 

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in the de-facto limitation of media reporting about news unrelated to the pandemic, justified by the government under its emergency response to Covid-19. These limits may or may not be allowed by law. Provide specific references to sources and comments to justify coding. 

*Scale*: Binary, (0/1) 

 0. No. 
 1. Yes. 

*Answer*: 0 

*Comments*:
 While there are de facto limitations as a consequence of or in relation to the pandemic, and continuing reports on journalists being charged with criminal offences for investigative reporting, no case has been found where the Turkish government or its agents have justified such acts of charging journalists for reporting on non-Covid-19 related news with any reference to the pandemic. Therefore, this is coded as 0.

## Limitations on access to information (*meinf*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, how often does the government and its agents limit media access to Covid-19 related information? 

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in how often the government and/or its agents limit media access to information about the nature of the Covid-19 virus (i.e. its origins, treatment, and prevalence), the government response, and/or other matters related to the pandemic. Provide specific references to sources and comments to justify coding. 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-2) 

 0. Never or almost never. There are no or almost no reports of the government or its agents limiting media access to Covid-19 related information. 
  1. Occasional. There are a few isolated reports of the government or government officials limiting media access to Covid-19 related information, but these are not systematic or ongoing. 
 2. Often. There are widespread and ongoing reports of the government and its agents limiting media access to Covid-19 related information. 

*Answer*: 2 

*Comments*:
 Much of the arrests of journalists, and charges placed on them, have been based on journalists accessing information from hospitals or hospital staff on Covid-19 which the governmnt do not want them publishing and spreading. The Turkish government has more or less closed all access to information on Covid-19 according to Reporters withour Borders and Amnesty International, and  only wish the media to report on the information on Covid-19 released by the government itself.
Furthermore, there are numerous accusations that the Turkish government have delibirately underreported the number of Covid-19 cases in the country.
This is therefore coded as 2.

## Government misinformation (*govmis*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, how often does information provided by the government or its agents about Covid-19 related matters deviate from the official information provided by the World Health Organization (WHO)? 

*Clarification*: This question is not about specific policies on Covid-19 or minor variations on how governments officially communicate about Covid-19-related matters (e.g. whether masks are recommended or not) but aims at capturing the dissemination of gravely misleading and false information by governments on key facts about Covid-19 such as what it is, how it is transmitted, or how it can be treated or cured. As a reference to “fact check” what is ``false", please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses. Coders should document the source showing the information from the government or its agents and explain how this deviates from the official WHO information (using the source and comments fields). 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0.  Never, or almost never. The information provided by the government and its agents' never or almost never deviates from the official information provided by the WHO.

## Physical violence by police, military (*pomviol*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, how often have security forces, such as the civilian police or military, engaged in physical violence to execute the emergency measures? 

*Clarification*: Physical violence refers to the use of force or intimidation to harm or kill another individual, forced unlawful confinement, or harassment (including physical, psychological, and sexual in nature). 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Never or almost never. Security forces seem to have engaged in little to no violence to execute the emergency measures. 
 1. Rarely. A few isolated incidents of security forces engaging in some non-lethal violence have been reported. 
 2. Sometimes. There are several reports of security forces engaging in violence to execute the emergency measures, and/or reports of deaths at the hands of security forces in response to Covid-19 enforcement. 
 3. Often. There are widespread reports about use of violence, sometimes with lethal outcomes, by security forces when executing emergency measures taken with reference to Covid-19. 

*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 There are some reports that the Turkish police have used force (tear gas, rubber bullets and detentions) when trying to stop HDP demonstrations against the government. Stopping these demonstrations have been made with reference to Covid-19, that the demonstrations contribute to spreading the disease and therefore needs to be stopped. These are however the only reports of such violence in enforcing the measures that have been found, and this is therefore coded as 1.

## Military involvement (*milinv*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, has the military been tasked with enforcing any confinement measures? 

*Clarification*: 'Confinement measures' refer to measures restricting citizens' freedom of movement. Such measures include  quarantines, lockdowns, curfews and  travel restriction within the country. 'The military' refers to the set of armed organizations responsible for external security that are primarily composed of active-duty members (as opposed to reserve forces). We are interested in whether the military has been given the power to ensure these measures are respected using coercion. We are not interested in whether the military is deployed to deliver aid or provide help to healthcare facilities.
