## Emergency measures legal instrument (*emlaw*) 

*Question*: What legal instrument has the state used to adopt a national-level emergency response to the Covid-19 pandemic? 

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in the primary legal instrument used to adopt and enforce the main national-level emergency measures with reference to Covid-19 since March 11, 2020. If the country has used multiple instruments, choose the one that most closely resembles a ``state of exception”, defined as a period during which one person or the government has enhanced powers and authority to limit rights and freedoms beyond what the law ordinarily allows (e.g. see [link](https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/S/bo3534874.html) (Agamben 2005). Note that the emergency measures may have ended by the time of coding. 

*Scale*: Categorical 

 1. Declaration of state of emergency, within existing legal framework. 
 2. Declaration of state of public health emergency, within existing legal framework that distinguishes between a public health emergency and a state of emergency. 
 3. Declaration of state of disaster / catastrophe, within existing legal frameworks where this differs from a state of emergency. 
 4. Adopting new legislation, where this differs from a state of emergency, public health emergency, or disaster/catastrophe. 
 5. None, the state has a national-level emergency response without specific reference to legal instruments. 
 6. None, the state has no national-level emergency response. 
 7. Other. 

*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 Egypt has been under a nationwide state of emergency since April 2017. It was extended for the 12th time on 28 April 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. On 22 April 2020, amendments were made to the 1958 Emergency Law (No. 162/1958) which gives sweeping powers to the president and security agencies. 

It has been extended every three months, at six month intervals to avoid violating the constitution.

## Time limit (*emlimit*) 

*Question*: Does implementation of the legal instrument used as the main national-level response to Covid-19 have an officially declared time limit? 

*Clarification*: This question refers to the legal instrument defined in *emlaw*. 

*Scale*: Binary (0/1). 

 0. No end date for some or all provisions. 
 1. Yes. 

*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 Under Art 154 of Egypt’s 2014 constitution, the president with parliamentary approval can declare a state of emergency for up to three months, with three-month extensions if approved by two-thirds of parliament. In this sense, there is an officially declared time limit. However, the current 596-member parliament is tightly controlled by intelligence agencies and dominated by the al-Sisi’s supporters. It has acted largely as a rubber stamp for his policies with almost no opposition.

## Legislature limitations (*leglimit*) 

*Question*: To what extent is the lawmaking role of the legislature limited due to any of the emergency measures taken with reference to the Covid-19 pandemic? 

*Clarification*: By national legislature, we mean the national body with powers to examine, pass, amend, or repeal laws.   The lawmaking role of the national legislature includes the de-jure and de-facto powers to introduce and pass legislation in all policy areas. This question asks specifically how the emergency measures have affected the lawmaking powers of the legislature. ``Rule by decree” enables the government to pass laws without the approval of the legislature, through what is commonly referred to as a decree, regulation, or ordinance, but can also be referred to by other terms.  If no legislature existed prior to Covid-19, code as 5. 

*Scale*: Categorical, (0-5) 

 0. Not at all. The lawmaking role of the national legislature is not affected. 
 1. Very little. The legislature has given the executive branch the power to relatively widely interpret Covid-19 related laws, but not to rule by decree. 
 2. Somewhat. The executive branch has the right to rule by decree on several, narrowly Covid-19 related issues such as deciding on physical distance measures and measures to support the health system. 
 3. To a large extent. The executive branch has the right to rule by decree on many issues, which may exceed Covid-19 related issues due to vague formulation in emergency laws. 
 4. Completely. The legislature has been dissolved, suspended or equivalent with reference to Covid-19. 
 5. No legislature existed prior to Covid-19. 

*Answer*: 0 

*Comments*:
 A state of emergency has been in place for Egypt since 10 April 2017, and was  extended on 28 April 2020 for three months due to the health and security emergencies. The legislature suspended one sitting from 08 April to 29 April due to the curfew measures. On 18 April 2020, it adopted legislation granting new powers to the president to implement specific emergency response measures without being able to rule by decree.

## Sub-national variation (*subvar*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, to what extent have the emergency measures referring to Covid-19 varied de jure at the sub-national level? 

*Clarification*: Coders should identify and cite sources indicating that subnational governments have implemented varying responses to the pandemic between 11 March 2020 until the coding date. 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Almost no variation. The emergency measures are uniform or nearly uniform throughout the country. 
 1. A little. There are a few sub-national areas where the emergency measures differ. 
 2. Somewhat. There are some sub-national areas where the emergency measures differ. 
 3. Almost completely. The emergency measures vary across all or almost all of the sub-national areas of the country.

## Discrim (*discrim*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, have any of the emergency measures that place restrictions on democratic rights or freedoms discriminated "solely on the ground of race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin" (ICCPR Art 4)? 

*Clarification*: This indicator captures whether the emergency measures have affected some groups' democratic rights and freedoms disproportionately based on their race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin in ways that cannot be justified by concerns for public health. Democratic rights and freedoms are defined as freedom of movement, assembly, association, and expression. This includes, for instance, quarantines for specific social groups without explicit virological indication. If measures are applied to neighborhoods due to prevalence of Covid-19 cases, this does not count as discrimination. Do not code cases of discrimination dealing with access to medical care, testing, or supplies. 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. No, not at all. 
 1. Not de-jure, but minor de-facto discrimination. 
 2. Not de-jure, but major, systematic de-facto discrimination. 
 3. Yes, minor de-jure discrimination. 
 4. Yes, major, systematic de-jure discrimination 

*Answer*: 0 

*Comments*:
 I did not find evidence of the emergency measures discriminating "solely on the grounds of race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin".

## Non-derogable rights (*ndrights*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, have any of the emergency measures de-jure violated non-derogable rights as defined by the ICCPR? 

*Clarification*: This question addresses the text of the main national-level emergency measures (de-jure). Do not consider the extent to which such provisions have been enforced. Non-derogable rights include: 
 - Right to life (Article 6). 
 - Freedom from torture and cruel/inhuman treatment (Article 7).  
 - Prohibition of slavery and servitude (Article 8, I and II). 
 - Prohibition of imprisonment due to inability to fulfill a contractual obligation (Article 11). 
 - No conviction for a crime which was not a crime at the time of commitment (Article 15). 
 - Right as a person before the law (Article 16). 
 - Freedom of thought, conscience and religion (Article 18). The detailed ICCPR provisions can be found [here](www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx). A temporary ban on religious services does NOT count as a violation of freedom of religion as long as all religions are targeted equally. Provide detailed information about the de-jure violations, including which non-derogable rights are violated in the ndrights_comments variable. 

*Scale*: Binary, (0/1) 

 0. No. 
 1. Yes. 

*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 Article 154 of Egypt’s constitution states that the two requirements needed to call a state of emergency are 

1: The approval by a “majority” of members of the House of Representative

2: The declaration is limited to three months. However this time limit can be extended for a similar period of time after obtaining the approval of two-thirds of the House members. Hence, a state of emergency could be continued indefinitely.

3. In Egypt parliament approved a bill that strengthened the state of emergency in place since 2017 and that already enabled large-scale human flights abuse.

The constitutional stipulation does not mention when and why the President of the Republic is allowed to declare a SoE, as opposed to Article 4 of the ICCPR, which permits derogations from ordinary human rights protections only in “time of public emergency which threatens the life of the nation”.

Article 154 does not specify a geographical limitation on state of emergencies and there is no limitation on the measures adopted under the state of emergency as is the case under Article 4 of the ICCPR, “to the extent strictly required by the exigencies of the situation.”

## Media limitations (*melim*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, to what extent do any emergency measures de-jure limit media freedom? 

*Clarification*: This addresses the text of the main national-level emergency measures (de-jure). Do not consider the extent to which such provisions have been enforced. Coders should only consider how the emergency measures affect media freedoms within the country, not other laws or practices. For instance, a case may be coded as 0 - "Not at all" if the emergency measures do not de-jure limit media freedoms, even if the case already had low media freedoms in practice prior to the crisis. 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Not at all. Media freedoms are not affected by the emergency measures. 
 1. Somewhat. The emergency measures de-jure allow the government to put some limitations on how the media can report on Covid-19. These provisions are explicitly limited to stopping disinformation on Covid-19, such as closing news websites that misreport on the origins or how the disease spreads (as a reference to 'fact check' what is 'disinformation'', please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided [here](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses)). 
 2. To a large extent. The emergency measures de-jure put strict limitations on how the media can report on Covid-19. These provisions are not limited to stopping the spread of disinformation on Covid-19, but include any reporting on Covid-19 such as the prevalence of the virus and the government response (as a reference to 'fact check' what is 'disinformation', please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided [here](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses)). 
 3. Almost completely. The emergency measures de-jure require that all or almost all media reporting on Covid-19 reflect the government's position.  

*Answer*: 2 

*Comments*:
 Emergency measures that have been in place since 2017 do restrict media freedom in multiple ways. The restrictions include 
1: Requiring online newspapers to register for permits to continue publishing.
2: Requiring media outlets to deposit sums (depending on the type of media) to bank accounts. The sums are high and act as deterrents to independent outlets.
3: The Supreme Council for Media Regulation has the power to block or suspend personal accounts if it decides that they are publishing or broadcasting fake news.
4: Art 3 of the State of Emergency Law 1958 states that once the state of emergency is imposed, the President has the right to put limitations on fundamental freedoms, including freedom of movement, assembly, residence and traffic in certain places or times. The same article allows for the surveillance of all forms of “correspondence” and expression, including newspapers and other publications before publication, and the power to shut down publication houses and confiscate materials for “public safety or issues of national security”.
5: Recently, the authorities have also warned that those who spread ‘false news’ about the coronavirus may face up to five years imprisonment and steep fines.

## Limitations on media reporting about Covid-19 (*merepfact*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, has the government placed de-facto limitations on media reporting about the nature of the Covid-19 virus? 

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in the de-facto limitation of media reporting on the virus, its origins, treatment, and prevalence. These limits may or may not be allowed by law. Provide specific references to sources and comments to justify coding. 

*Scale*: Binary, (0/1) 

 0. No. 
 1. Yes. 

*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 1: The Egyptian health ministry repeatedly labelled a Taiwanese tourist as the source of the outbreak in Luxor, then did not acknowledge nor provide further explanation after Taiwan’s Centre for Disease Control refuted this entirely (with evidence).  

2: There are large discrepancies in the Egyptian governments reporting on the prevalence of Covid-19 in Egypt and the situation as described by other international sources. Eg: Uni of Toronto states that there should have been 6270 to 45050 cases in early March. However the country’s official number at the same point in time was three.

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, has the government placed de-facto limitations on media reporting about the government response to the Covid-19 pandemic? 

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in the de-facto limitation of media reporting about news on the government responses to Covid-19. If this includes limitations on reporting about the government's official messaging on the pandemic (e.g. its prevalence, treatment, or origins), code this and *merepfact*  as 1- Yes. These limits may or may not be allowed by law. Provide specific references to sources and comments to justify coding.

 There has been restrictions on the government’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic. 

1: Ruth Michaelson, a journalist with The Guardian who had been living and working in Egypt had to leave the country after she reported on research by infectious disease specialists from the University of Toronto as well as public health data and news stories that pointed to Egypt having a higher rate of coronavirus cases than reported by the government.

2: In March, security forces arrested an Egyptian journalist for questioning official statistics in relation to the spread of COVID-19 on his personal Facebook page. He was held at an undisclosed location without any contact with the outside world for nearly a month before being brought in front of prosecutors to face accusations of “spreading false news” and “joining a terrorist organization”.

3: Doctors and pharmacists have been arrested for speaking out against the government’s response to the virus.

## Limitations on media reporting about non-Covid-19 related news (*merepoth*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, has the government placed de-facto limitations on media reporting about non-Covid-19 related news, but with reference to the pandemic? 

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in the de-facto limitation of media reporting about news unrelated to the pandemic, justified by the government under its emergency response to Covid-19. These limits may or may not be allowed by law. Provide specific references to sources and comments to justify coding.

 0. No. 
 1. Yes.

*Comments*:
 18 amendments were made to the emergency law. However, only five were clearly linked to public health developments. Examples of the amendments that are not directly linked to the public health developments:

1: Allows the president even in the absence of any public health purpose, to restrict “public gatherings, protests, rallies, festivities, and any other form of gathering, including private gatherings.”

2: Allows the president to restrict anyone from owning, transporting, selling, purchasing, or exporting any goods or services. The amendments also allow him to control prices of goods and services and to “determine methods of collecting monetary and in-kind donations … and rules of their dispensing and spending.”

## Limitations on access to information (*meinf*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, how often does the government and its agents limit media access to Covid-19 related information? 

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in how often the government and/or its agents limit media access to information about the nature of the Covid-19 virus (i.e. its origins, treatment, and prevalence), the government response, and/or other matters related to the pandemic. Provide specific references to sources and comments to justify coding. 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-2) 

 0. Never or almost never. There are no or almost no reports of the government or its agents limiting media access to Covid-19 related information. 
  1. Occasional. There are a few isolated reports of the government or government officials limiting media access to Covid-19 related information, but these are not systematic or ongoing. 
 2. Often. There are widespread and ongoing reports of the government and its agents limiting media access to Covid-19 related information. 

*Answer*: 2 

*Comments*:
 1: Journalists who have reported on the Corona virus and accused the government of understating the situation in Egypt have been asked to leave the country.

2: Currently, more than 500 websites—many of them connected to news outlets—are blocked inside the country. 

3: In April 2020, the authorities blocked a local news site that covered calls by activists to release political prisoners over fears of the coronavirus spreading in Egypt’s crowded prisons.

4: Doctors and pharmacists have been arrested for speaking out against the government’s response to the virus.

5: Ruth Michaelson, a journalist with The Guardian who had been living and working in Egypt had to leave the country after she reported on research by infectious disease specialists from the University of Toronto as well as public health data and news stories that pointed to Egypt having a higher rate of coronavirus cases than the number confirmed by the government.

## Government misinformation (*govmis*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, how often does information provided by the government or its agents about Covid-19 related matters deviate from the official information provided by the World Health Organization (WHO)? 

*Clarification*: This question is not about specific policies on Covid-19 or minor variations on how governments officially communicate about Covid-19-related matters (e.g. whether masks are recommended or not) but aims at capturing the dissemination of gravely misleading and false information by governments on key facts about Covid-19 such as what it is, how it is transmitted, or how it can be treated or cured. As a reference to “fact check” what is ``false", please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses. Coders should document the source showing the information from the government or its agents and explain how this deviates from the official WHO information (using the source and comments fields). 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0.  Never, or almost never. The information provided by the government and its agents' never or almost never deviates from the official information provided by the WHO. 
 1. Occasionally. There are a few reported instances where the government or its agents have communicated information on Covid-19 that deviates from the official information provided by the WHO, but this is not necessarily intentional. 
 2. Often. The government or some of its agents frequently disseminate information on many key issues concerning Covid-19 that deviates from official information provided by the WHO. 
 3. Always or almost always. The government and its agents systematically disseminate information on a wide range of basic matters concerning Covid-19 that always or almost always deviates from the official information provided by the WHO. 

*Answer*: 0 

*Comments*:
 I did not find any information on covid-19 related matters deviating from the official information provided by the WHO.

*Clarification*: Physical violence refers to the use of force or intimidation to harm or kill another individual, forced unlawful confinement, or harassment (including physical, psychological, and sexual in nature). 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Never or almost never. Security forces seem to have engaged in little to no violence to execute the emergency measures. 
 1. Rarely. A few isolated incidents of security forces engaging in some non-lethal violence have been reported. 
 2. Sometimes. There are several reports of security forces engaging in violence to execute the emergency measures, and/or reports of deaths at the hands of security forces in response to Covid-19 enforcement. 
 3. Often. There are widespread reports about use of violence, sometimes with lethal outcomes, by security forces when executing emergency measures taken with reference to Covid-19. 

*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 There have been a few cases of security forces engaging in non-lethal violence.

## Military involvement (*milinv*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, has the military been tasked with enforcing any confinement measures? 

*Clarification*: 'Confinement measures' refer to measures restricting citizens' freedom of movement. Such measures include  quarantines, lockdowns, curfews and  travel restriction within the country. 'The military' refers to the set of armed organizations responsible for external security that are primarily composed of active-duty members (as opposed to reserve forces). We are interested in whether the military has been given the power to ensure these measures are respected using coercion. We are not interested in whether the military is deployed to deliver aid or provide help to healthcare facilities.
