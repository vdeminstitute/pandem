 Reports of physical assault and detention of several journalists in April 2020. I have not found any new information in July-September 2020. Since cases of physical harassment of journalists are monitored by various sources (Council of Europe, IPI, CPJ) on a case by case bases, lack of information likely means that there were no further cases of physical harrassment.

 1: Journalist Sajal Bhuiyan was working on a report in the Narsingdi district on the rice crisis in Bangladesh amid the coronavirus pandemic. He was beaten up by an official and his supporter when trying to do his work. He sustained injuries to the head and eye and had to be warded in the hospital.

2: 15 journalists have been attacked in Bangladesh in the April and May for their reporting on COVID-19 issues.

As I have not found information suggesting that the situation in Bangladesh has improved, I have continued to code this variable as 1.

 A journalist has been arrested and jailed for reporting on a Covid-19 death. This is however the only report found on physical harassment of journalists, and it does seem to be no recurring or systematic practice in relation to Covid-19 reporting. There is therefore not reason to believe that such harassment should have continued into the Jul-Sep and Oct-Dec periods, and it is coded 1 only for the first period.

''Congolese reporter charged with violating Covid-19 restrictions, May 9, 2020
Faustin Mbiya, a journalist at Foundation Daniel Madimba radio station based in Mbuji-Mayi, was arrested on 9 May on his return from producing a broadcast in Tshilenge, 25 km to the east. He was freed on bail of 300,000 Congolese francs (160 euros) on 12 May pending trial on charges of “violating emergency health measures” and “insulting the provincial authorities.”''

''Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) police deliberately ran down television journalist Tholi Totali Glody in Likasi on March 22, 2020, in the country’s Haut-Katanga province of Glody, who works for Alfajari TV, a local station, and who was reporting on compliance to the lockdown decreed by the provincial government.''

 Greek police detained and attacked a Greek journalist, Antonis Rigopoulos, on November 17 while he was covering a rally in commemoration of the 1973 Polytechnic University student uprising against the military dictatorship. 

''As the journalist was documenting the arrest of protesters, he was approached by traffic police officers, and despite the fact that he was wearing a full gas mask, police tried to fine him €300 under COVID-19 regulations for not wearing a surgical mask. The officers then brought him to the headquarters of the Traffic Police where Rigopoulos claims they addressed him in a threatening and abusive manner in an attempt to provoke him. He later reported that one officer pushed him forcefully into a chair and shouted aggressively in his face. Rigopoulos added that officers repeatedly refused to acknowledge his journalistic ID and took his national ID off him for about half an hour.''

 Reports of arrests of journalists covering government's response to the pandemic:  "Kazak authorities arrest two KTK TV journalists reporting on hospital working conditions on April 11, 2020. Police in the western city of Atyrau arrested journalist Beken Alirakhimov and cameraman Manas Sharipov of KTK TV as they were interviewing doctors and reporting on working conditions at a hospital in the city. The pair were charged with “violating the state of emergency” under Article 476 of the Administrative Code. They were found guilty on April 24 and were placed under forced quarantine for two weeks in hospital." (IPI)  Since cases of physical harassment of journalists are monitored by various sources (IPI, CPJ) on a case by case bases, lack of information likely means that there were no further cases of physical harrassment.

While no reports of this occuring has been found in the Oct-Dec period, there is no indication that the situation has improved. Furthermore, those jailed in the previous period are still incarcerated as far as have been seen. This is therefore coded 1 for all three periods.

 'On May 3, the authorities arrested a blogger, Mommeu Ould Bouzouma over a tweet in which he criticised as "erratic" the enforcement of COVID-19 lockdown in the district of Tiris Zemmour. Bouzouma, who is also the correspondent of the news website Alakhbar.info in Zouerate, was released after spending 12 days in detention.

On June 2, the police arrested Salma Mint Tolba, the alleged author of a series of audio recordings questioning aspects of the government's response to the COVID-19. Notably, she accused the authorities of inflating the number of infections. Two other people, Mohamed Ould Semmane and Sidi Mohamed Ould Beyah, who were suspected to have participated in the dissemination of the audio, were also arrested.'' (1)

*Comments*:
 Citizens and journalists have been detained in Morocco for expressing their views:  ''According to the Moroccan Association for Human Rights (AMDH), as of March 2020, the number of prisoners detained for legitimately expressing their views across the country reached 110. On 28th March 2020, the secretary general of the presidency of the public prosecutor's office reported that the police had arrested 450 individuals for breaking the public health emergency law and 56 for publishing false information on COVID-19. The situation of those detained and imprisoned are being monitored by rights groups.
Human rights groups have called for the release of those freely expressing their opinion, including the release of journalists. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) issued a statement to all African countries, including Morocco, where four journalists are imprisoned and called for the release of jailed journalists and to protect the free press and the free flow of information at this crucial time.'' (1)

Also, a Moroccan citizen journalist, Ibrahim Amrikli, was charged on 17 May by the prosecutor of the Court of First Instance in Laayoune with "breaking orders related to the health emergency status",based on the health emergency Decree law passed in March 2020, and with "offending public officials", based on article 263of the penal code. The trial was postponed for the end of September. (2)

In addition, ''Journalist Nazha ElKhalidi and her fiancée have been put under house arrest since November 21. The journalist was detained by Moroccan security services due to her coverage of human rights violations by Moroccan authorities in Western Sahara. She has recently noted and reported the crackdown on freedom of expression by the Morrocan authorities in Western Sahara. Morrocan authorities claimed that this measure is part of its COVID-19 precautionary procedures. Nazha and her fiancée confirmed that social distancing and other precautionary measures were taken into account when organizing the ceremony.'' (3)

I have not found new cases of jounalists being physically harrassed in the Oct/Dec period. However, given the high frequency at which such things occured at the beginning of the pandemic and Nepal's controlled media environemnt, I have coded this variable as 1.

''Journalist and media worker arrested for violating curfew in Rwanda:
Police in Rwanda arrested journalist Dieudonné Niyonsenga and media worker Fidèle Komezusenge for violating the country’s COVID-19 lockdown. Both were on their way to report at the time. The Rwanda Investigation Bureau announced criminal charges on Twitter. Rwanda’s lockdown does not explicitly exempt journalists from moving freely to work.''

Also: ''At least four bloggers were arrested in Rwanda earlier this month for violating the government's directives, as they tried to cover coronavirus lockdown measures, according to Human Rights Watch.''

Also: ''TV director Hassan had notably finished a sensitive report investigating the impact of Rwanda’s lockdown measures on locals in poor districts. “These journalists were asking questions about why authorities were demolishing homes deemed unstable in working class areas without compensating their occupants,” Laurent Munyandilikirwa, head of Rwanda’s Observatory for human rights told RFI. The government argues the measure was to protect inhabitants from torrential rains, but Munyandilikirwa says their homes were never located in flood-prone areas to begin with. “They (the journalists) crossed the red line by seeking the truth,” believes the rights defender, who has urged the government to release any media professional detained for their Covid-19 coverage.''

Several journalists were physically harassed by the police while covering anti-lockdown protests in July 2020. Since the journalists were not reporting about Covid-19 and there was only one incident of physical harassment related to reporting on Covid-19, mephar is coded as 0 in July-September, October-December.

 Journalist Fayia Amara was beated by the military as he was reporting on covid-19 quarantine centre on 1 April 2020. The journalist was mob-beaten by 9 military officials, suffered severe injuries and reportedly collapse when he appeared in court. Since it was a single incident and I found no information of further violations, mephar is coded as 1 only during March-June.

 The police aggressively pushed and broke camera equipment of a journalist reporting on anti-lockdown protests on 29 April 2020. Since cases of physical harassment of journalists are monitored by various sources (Council of Europe, IPI, CPJ) on a case by case bases, lack of information likely means that there were no further cases of physical harrassment.
